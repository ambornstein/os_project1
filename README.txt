For our slug race, we decided to keep track of slugs in an array that stored their PIDs. When a slug finished, it overwrote the stored value with a 0. This allowed us to keep track of child PIDs and active slugs.

We executed our programs, so we did not take advantage of an IDE testing or debugging features. We opted to strategically place print statements throughout the programs in testing to confirm that certain lines were being run.
